# Behavioral interview questions

The idea for behavioral interview questions is to get an idea of how you solve non-defined problems.
Here, you are either tasked with working through hypothetical scenarios or abstract problems, or to describe how you resolved problems in the past, which should indicate some sort of skill or character about yourself.

## Questions

1. Describe your background and what you are good at
2. Describe a time at work when you had to deal with a change in requirement for the project
3. Discuss the most challenging problem you've solved
4. Explain <technology> you use at work (be ready for deepdive into this)
